    Swiftclient instantiation now provides authentication
    information so that long lived swiftclient objects can
    reauthenticate if necessary. This should be a temporary
    situation until swiftclient supports keystoneauth
    sessions at which point os-client-config will instantiate
    swiftclient with a keystoneauth session.
features:
  - Swiftclient instantiation now provides authentication
    information so that long lived swiftclient objects can
    reauthenticate if necessary.
  - Add support for explicit v2password auth type.
  - Add SSL support to VEXXHOST vendor profile.
  - Add zetta.io cloud vendor profile.
fixes:
  - Fix bug where project_domain_{name,id} was set even
    if project_{name,id} was not set.
other:
  - HPCloud vendor profile removed due to cloud shutdown.
  - RunAbove vendor profile removed due to migration to
    OVH.
